# Pecha Kucha

## Slide 1
- Name
- Android Dev

### Notes
- I'm pretty new here. Nearly 4 years.
- I think I know of you, but for those who don't, I'm Dan

## Slide 2

- From Harrogate, England, proud yorkshireman (yorkshire tea)
- Famous for its sulphur water and for hosting the eurovision song contest well before I was born
- probably know it as wet, grey
- photos of grey england
- but there are some pretty places there, too

## Slide 3

- Went to uni in Bristol for comp sci
- ran MAD theatre tech? (if can find photos)
- and was a DJ for all of the formal events in my uni halls. specialising in cheesy music. I have a spotify playlist with upwards of 240 songs, in case anyone is interested

## Slide 4

- Moved to London to work for Smile Machine, a small app agency, out of uni
- Worked on various projects for some pretty big brands (rolls-royce, jaguar/land rover, star wars)
- Company decided to ship me off to Spain to try to start an office in Barcelona, but it was probably a mistake to send 2 devs who liked to drink
- photo of gareth and I in barcelona

## Slide 5

- There was, however, something good which came out of this, met my now fiancee in Barcelona
- Of course, it wasn't a Spanish person, but instead, Irish. I'm convinced she moved to Spain with the intention of finding a tall, dark, mysterious Spanish stranger, but instead found me.

## Slide 6

- After various moves back to London, and elsewhere in Spain, finally settled in Valencia and we've been here for the last 3 years
- As a local, now, I have to tell you that "paella" is only "paella" if it comes from Valencia, and only if it consists of Rice, saffron, chicken, rabbit, butter beans and, optionally, snails. Anything else is "Rice with stuff"

## Slide 7

- Used to be a member of a band, Dirty Rigsby
- Played Bass
- However it's very difficult to find our recordings
- Would love to have a reunion gig, but we're now all spread across the globe

- With the same group we made a short film, but unfortunately this is also lost to time. However, it is where my slack profile picture came from (show wheels image)

## Slide 8

- I've had pets throughout my life. Various golden retrievers
- I'm now dad to 2 5 month old kittens, Sylvester and Mona
- You might see them walking in front of my camera when I'm on zoom calls as they've decided that the most comfortable place to be is in front of whatever I'm trying to do


## Slide 9
